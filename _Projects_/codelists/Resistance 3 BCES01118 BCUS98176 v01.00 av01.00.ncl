It's better than the
health code because now
you no longer get blood on
the screen nor do enemy
attacks cause you to
flinch so it's easier for
you to shoot and see.

If anybody needs it I
found a static path to
player health that is
this:
F8(0(208(0101DCD8)))

At 00F0 and 00F4 there is
also 42C80000 which is the

of them is likely max
health.

/*
Requires the code that
dumps the weapon addresses
to be turned on 1st, or
else this will not work
but it will not crash your
game or anything.

This is specifically
useful if you want rapid
fire to only work for your
weapons and not for
enemies or turrets or
other things like that.

This will interfere with
the code for rapid fire
secondary v2 because it
occupies the same area, so
either choose that or the
rapid fire codes that need
the weapon address table.

This completes the
collection now since
before I could only find
the weapons and not the
grenades.

Turn this on with the code
for grenades to never
decrease and you will have
unlimited of all 5 at the
start of the game.

There also seems to be a
5th grenade type but it
never displays an icon.
It is on the far left and
when you throw the grenade
it has multiple grenade
effects or whatever.
I did not use grenades
much.
