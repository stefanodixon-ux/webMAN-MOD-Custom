Debug Menu

IDontModLobbies
/*
You will need to go to
/USRDIR/COMMON/SETTINGS/
and edit SETTINGS.CFG
which is just a plain txt
file.

At lines 207 and 208
should be these 2 lines:

Engine.AllowMenuDebug = false;
Engine.AllowLoadingInfoDebug = false;

Change both from false to
true and save.

To access the debug menu
in game, pause and hold
L3 + R3 for 3 seconds to
make it appear.
