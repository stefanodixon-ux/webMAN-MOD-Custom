This can be useful for
road rage or marked man
because opponents drive in
circles backing up and and
moving forward like they
can not figure out how to
drive.

/*
This causes opponents to
lose control if you are
near them. At the
beginning of a race
opponents will not move,
but if you get far enough
away they will, and when
they catch up whatever
they are doing they will
keep doing, so if they are
driving forward in a
straight line they will do
that until they hit a
wall. If they were turning
they will drive in
circles. In Road Rage this
is not useful because
opponents will drive
straight into walls and
crash themselves.

In road rage it will still
tell you to repair your
car, but it affects
nothing, you can still
wreck your car 100
consecutive times and
never lose the event.
